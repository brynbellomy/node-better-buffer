# // better-buffer

part of me wanted to call this module `node-miyagi`.

please god let someone get the joke.  preferably a girl.  preferably gorgeous.

# why

It blows my mind that these methods don't exist on the core node.js `Buffer`
object.  srsly guise?

# how

Install with npm.

```sh
npm install better-buffer
```

# what

## BetterBuffer (initialSize, growSize = 512)

Constructor is compatible with existing `Buffer` constructor, but also adds an
optional `growSize` parameter.  The only time that a `BetterBuffer` will grow
is when you call the `growToAccommodate()` method -- there's no auto-growing on
`BetterBuffer::pushBack()` or `Buffer::copy()` -- at least not yet.

## BetterBuffer::growToAccommodate (dataLengthToAccommodate)

Ensures that the buffer is at least big enough to store `dataLengthToAccommodate`
octets.  The buffer will grow in intervals defind by its `growSize` member, so
you may sometimes end up with a buffer that's slightly larger than necessary.

## BetterBuffer::pushBack (sourceBuffer)

Queue-like functionality for buffers. Appends `sourceBuffer` to the buffer at
the end of that buffer's actual data, as indicated by its `dataLength` member. So
for example, if you have:

```javascript
var myBuffer = new BetterBuffer(10, 5);
// myBuffer.length == 10
// myBuffer.dataLength == 0
```

...and you append, say, `secondBuffer`, the `length` of which is `6`:

```javascript
myBuffer.pushBack(secondBuffer);
// myBuffer.length == 10
// myBuffer.dataLength == 6
```

`myBuffer.dataLength` is now 6.  Now let's append `thirdBuffer`, the length of
which is `2`:

```javascript
myBuffer.pushBack(thirdBuffer);
// myBuffer.length == 10
// myBuffer.dataLength == 8
```

`myBuffer.dataLength` is now 8, and `thirdBuffer` was written into `myBuffer`
starting at position 6.

In combination with `BetterBuffer::popFront()`, this makes it much easier to
create queue- or stream-like behavior using simple buffer objects.

The buffer's `dataLength` property is incremented accordingly.

## BetterBuffer::popFront (num)

Just a simple `pop` function, like you'd find on a stack or queue.  Hacks off the
first `num` octets in the buffer, shifts everything in the buffer forward by the
same distance, and returns the popped octets in a new `BetterBuffer` object.

The buffer's `dataLength` property is decremented accordingly.

## BetterBuffer::cloneDataIntoNewBuffer ()

Creates a new `BetterBuffer` containing an exact copy of the contents of the
buffer.  __NOTE:__ the returned buffer's size is equal to the source buffer's
`dataLength` property, not its `length` property.

For example, let's say you have a buffer `myBuffer` of size `256`, and you've only
`pushBack`ed one buffer of size `100` into it.  This means that `myBuffer.length`
is `256`, but `myBuffer.dataLength` is `100`. So when you call
`cloneDataIntoNewBuffer`, it will return a buffer of size `100`, not `256`.

# tl;dr (for the hyperactive and/or distractible)

```javascript
var myBuf = new BetterBuffer(10, 5);
myBuf.fill(0x00);
// myBuf.length == 10
// myBuf.dataLength == 0
// myBuf = <Buffer 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00>

var smallerBuffer = new BetterBuffer(8);
smallerBuffer.fill(0xff); 
// smallerBuffer.length == 8
// smallerBuffer.dataLength == 0
// smallerBuffer = <Buffer ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff>

// now we explicitly set smallerBuffer.dataLength -- it's not necessary, but
// it makes things clearer conceptually
smallerBuffer.dataLength = smallerBuffer.length;

// what happens when we call growToAccommodate to ensure we have enough room?
myBuf.growToAccommodate(smallerBuffer.dataLength);
// smallerBuffer is smaller than myBuf, so myBuf.length is still 10

// go ahead and eat the smaller buffer
myBuf.pushBack(smallerBuffer); 
// myBuf = <Buffer ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 00>
// myBuf.length == 10
// myBuf.dataLength == 8

var anotherBuffer = new BetterBuffer(8);
anotherBuffer.fill(0xaa);
// anotherBuffer.length == 8
// anotherBuffer.dataLength == 0
// anotherBuffer = <Buffer aa aa aa aa aa aa aa aa>

// again, we explicitly set anotherBuffer.dataLength for the sake of code readability
anotherBuffer.dataLength = anotherBuffer.length;

// let's try calling growToAccommodate again and see if anything happens this time
myBuf.growToAccommodate(myBuf.dataLength + anotherBuffer.dataLength);
// now, myBuf.length == 20 because:
//     myBuf.dataLength == 8
//     anotherBuffer.dataLength == 8
// and myBuf.growSize == 5 (myBuf's initial size was 10, and 10 + 5 + 5 == 20)

// now we can pushBack() safely
myBuf.pushBack(anotherBuffer);
// myBuf = <Buffer ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff aa aa aa aa aa aa aa aa 00 00 00 00>
// myBuf.length == 20
// myBuf.dataLength == 16

// and just for good measure let's tack on a shitty example of popFront()
var justAPiece = myBuf.popFront(5);
// justAPiece = <Buffer ff ff ff ff ff>
// myBuf = <Buffer ff ff ff aa aa aa aa aa aa aa aa 00 00 00 00>
```
